For improve usage and communication with scrooge we are prepared api. Currently, there is only push api implemented and used to pushing usages data by services. In the future we plan create pull api for getting report data for single venture/service. For communication with API we use JSON as a message formant and REST API for maintenance of communication standards.

PUSH API
--------
Before you start using push api, first you need to create service and usages manually. When you have created service and usages then you can start push to scrooge by using api.

PULL API
