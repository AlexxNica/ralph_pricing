When we start talking about financials and accounting, many times we are associate with definition of creative accounting, povisions, adjustments or acceptable deviation but the one think is really stable and unchanged "History". Scrooge provide create historical statements manually. One way is just create report for past date but for be sure in one hundred procent historical raport will be the same, you can create a statement manually. 

Logic for create statements is as simple as can be. Generated report is converte JSON and write in database. JSON cannot by change by any user so, it can you feel safe, your historical report will be saved forever. This simple case protects us from human mistakes like change invoice cost for the past date or rebuild/upgrade custom plugins. This is a really important case when system is fexibility and allows you to create custom and dedicated logic for some parts.
